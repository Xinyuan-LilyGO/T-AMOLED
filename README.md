## Where to buy

T-AMOLED is available from: [LILYGO](), [Amazon]() and [Aliexpress]().

## Quick Start

The board uses USB as the JTAG upload port. When printing serial port information on USB, CDC_ON_BOOT configuration needs to be turned on. 
If the port cannot be found when uploading the program or the USB has been used for other functions, the port does not appear. 
Please enter the upload mode manually. 
-  Press and hold the BOOT button when the power is off, the button is located behind the RST button.
-  When the USB is connected, first press and hold the BOOT button, then click reset and then release the BOOT button

## Tips

1. Use board as delivered. Connect board to usb to computer without
touching anything else. Upload the code. The code will start right after
download and run. Unplug the board and connect to usb again. The board
will not do anything.

2. Use board as delivered. Push down boot button. While boot button is
pushed, connect usb to computer. Release boot button. Upload the code.
The code will not start right after download. Nothing will happen.
Unplug the board and connect to usb again.The board will now boot the
code. Unplug the board from USB to computer and connect to other power
source like LiPO battery. Again the board will start the code. The
computer is not needed again.

New code can be loaded to the board by going to step 1 or 2. Both will
still work.
